    description: The algorithm descriptors that are returned by an instance of the OaaS node. This info is typially cached- stored when the image 
      of the repo is registered in the OaaS node, since a test instantiation is made at that time to validate the image API,
      and we take the opportunity to retrieve the algorithm descriptors, which do not change while the image does not change.
